4. **NEW**: Automatically runs analysis if dashboard data is missing
5. Launches the interactive dashboard at `http://localhost:8501`

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer step-by-step control:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setup environment and models
python3 setup_environment.py

# Download and prepare dataset
python3 data_acquisition.py

# Run full analysis (if needed)
jupyter notebook NewsBot_Intelligence_System.ipynb

# Launch dashboard
streamlit run dashboard/newsbot_dashboard.py
```
